# Dragon Sword
## _Fight with and against Dragons_

## MainFeatures

> The Main Goal of the Game is to make a simple,

> In further Development it should be open for a possible Multiplayer 
> Also keep it open to give the Dragon the Controls
> so switching between Player and Dragon should be possible
